# Lung-Nodule-Train-Test-Data

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of lung cancer from medical imaging data (e.g., CT scans, X-rays). The goal is to build an efficient and accurate model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential lung cancer cases, enabling early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

The system uses advanced techniques in computer vision and deep learning to analyze the images and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. It can be extended or adapted to various other types of cancer detection systems.

## Features
1. Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to enhance important features for better detection accuracy.
2. Model: A deep learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to identify the presence of lung cancer in medical images.
3. Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to ensure its performance.

## Test Data
This project uses a test dataset containing a variety of images, which may include labeled samples of lung scans with known cancer diagnoses. The data can be used to test the model's ability to detect cancerous regions in the images. Make sure to reference the data source appropriately if it is publicly available or if any licenses are required for usage.
